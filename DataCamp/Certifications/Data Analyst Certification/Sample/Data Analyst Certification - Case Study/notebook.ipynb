Also, we can see the number of cars sold in petrol is almost twice the number of cars sold in hybrid. Therefore, we can conclude that there is huge room to impove the sales of hybrid cars. \n\n![Number of Used Cars Sold by Fuel Type](fueltype.png)\n\nIf we only look at hybrid cars. From the bar chart below, the best seller in car models is Yaris, followed by Auris and C-HR.\n\n![Number of Used Cars using Hybrid Sold by Car Model](hybrid.png)\n\nWe also want to compare the price of all the cars we sold last 6 months. I was looking at the distribution of price. The majority of used cars sold last 6 months is less than 30000 GBP. Used cars sold for more than 30000 GBP could be considered outliers.\n\n![The Distribution of Price](Price.png)\n\nFrom the multiple boxplots below, we can see the price range in hybrid cars is more significant than other fuel types. The majority of the price of a hybrid car range from 13000 to 21000 GBP, which is higher than petrol and diesel. I am not sure of the meaning of the fuel type in ‘Others,’ so I cannot conclude anything about that type until I have further information.\n\nPetrol cars, the largest rival of the hybrid cars, majorly sold from 9000 to 12000 GBP. But as you can see from this graph, a few hybrid cars are also sold in this range.\n\n\n![The Distribution of Price by Fuel Type](./pricefueltype.png)\n","metadata":{},"id":"c22f7f5b-2a69-4515-8b29-7b0e94829f11","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## How to Make the Hybrid more Attractive?\nSince the Hybrid models are more expensive than other types on average, we will find different ways to attract customers. From the multiple boxplots below, **Prius, Yaris and Auris** have records of selling lower than 10000 GBP in the last 6 months, which is competitive with the petrol cars. Therefore, for people concerned about price, we should make these three models our major campaign car models.\n\n\n![The Distribution of Price by Car Model](./pricemodel.png)\n\nThe other attractive information is the tax. From the bar chart below, we can see the most common road tax for the petrol model is 145 GBP,  while the most common road tax for the hybrid model is 0 GBP. Therefore, for people buying traditional fuel-type car models, a Hybrid might be an excellent choice based on this information.\n\n![The Distribution of Tax by Car Model](taxfueltype.png)","metadata":{},"id":"5fa9dfc0-5453-4173-b74c-c1401a5e9c3f","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Business Metrics\nSince our goal is to increase the number of sales of hybrid and electric cars next year, I would recommend we use **the percentage of hybrid and electric cars in total number of used cars sold last 6 months** as our metric. \n\nBased on our last 6 month data, 30% of the used cars sold are hybrid and electric cars.
